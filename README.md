# Face-Extractor  
A Python tool that can extract Faces from Images.  

I also built a similar tool capable of **[Facial recognition](https://github.com/JeeveshN/Facial-Recognition-Tool)**.

## Installations
```
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```
## Usage:
```
python detect_face.py "Image path or just name if in same folder"
```
## Demo:

### Command
![](/extras/2.png?raw=True)
### Detected Faces
![](/extras/1.png?raw=True)
### The Extracted Images
![](/extras/3.png?raw=True)  
  
**Note**:If some faces are not detected try reducing the value of scalefactor in Detect_face.py on Line 20
